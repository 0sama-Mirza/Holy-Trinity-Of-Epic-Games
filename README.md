# Holy-Trinity-Of-Epic_Games
This is a project that I did in our 2nd semester.
# What does it do?
2 people battle against each other in a best of 5 playing 3 games:
1) Tick Cross
2) Tap Tap!(Which is quite brutal)
3) Snake game like Agar.io but on the terminal!
There is no need to explain what tick cross does.
# Tap Tap!
Two people will battle each other by pressing one single button. The one who is faster will be victorious!
# Snake Game
If you have played Agar.io you already know what kind of game this is. 2 Snakes battle against each other. Their Ultimate goal is to kill the other snake. You can kill the other by making the other snake's head touch your body or by becoming a bigger snake and eating the other from the head!
# If you want to improve the code feel free to do so.
